![demo](./readme_assets/demo.gif)

- There are 3 modes when inserting a new tile: starting, finish, and wall tile.
  The current mode is also displayed on the bottom of the screen, along with
  the pathfinding status.
    - Press `1` to insert the starting tile
    - Press `2` to insert the finish tile
    - Press `3` to insert wall

  After pressing the key, you can left-click anywhere in the map to insert a new tile
  and right-click to remove tile

- To start the pathfinding process, press `Enter` key
- After the pathfinding process is done, press `Enter` again
  to restart. This will only erase the path and the visited tile, while
  keeping everything else in the same position
- To reset everything, press `r`. This will erase every tile and place starting
  and finish tile in their initial place
